- Given a dictionary like ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}``: , list two ways you
  can try to get a missing key (like "c") *without* your programming

- What is the role of web application framework, like Flask?
    A. It provides a structured set of tools, libraries, and conventions to help developers build scalable, maintainable, and organized web applications.
- You can pass information to Flask either as a parameter in a route URL
  (like '/foods/pretzel') or using a URL query param (like
  'foods?type=pretzel'). How might you choose which one is a better fit
  for an application?
    A. It depends on the requirements of the application that you are working on such as semantic meaning, readability, SEO considerations, and the nature of the information being passed. 
- How do you collect data from a URL placeholder parameter using Flask?
    A. You collect the data by using route parameters. 
- How do you collect data from the query string using Flask?
    A. In Flask, you can collect data from the query string using the request.args object.
- How do you collect data from the body of the request using Flask?
    A. You request the data from the body using the `request` object. 
- What is a cookie and what kinds of things are they commonly used for?
    A. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website sends to the user's web browser while the user is browsing. The browser stores this data, and the cookie is sent back to the server with subsequent requests to the same site. Cookies are commonly used to store information about the user's interactions with the website or to track their browsing behavior. 
- What is the session object in Flask?
    A. In Flask, the session object is a built-in object that allows you to store information across requests.
- What does Flask's `jsonify()` do?
    A. It is used to create a JSON response from a Python dictionary or another JSON-serializable object.
